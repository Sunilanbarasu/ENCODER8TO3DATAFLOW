### ENCODER 8TO3 DATAFLOW Modelling

**AIM:**

To implement  Encoder 8 To 3 in Dataflow Modelling using verilog and validating their functionality using their functional tables

**SOFTWARE REQUIRED:** Quartus prime

**THEORY**

**Encoder 8 To 3**

The 8 to 3 line Encoder is also known as Octal to Binary Encoder. In 8 to 3 line encoder, there is a total of eight inputs, i.e., D0, D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, and D7 and three outputs, i.e., A0, A1, and A2. In 8-input lines, one input-line is set to true at a time to get the respective binary code in the output side. Below are the block diagram and the truth table of the 8 to 3 line encoder.

The logical expression of the term A0, A1, and A2 are as follows:

A0 = D1 + D3 + D5 + D7

A1 = D2 + D3 + D6 + D7

A2 = D4 + D5 + D6 + D7

Logical circuit of the above expressions is given below:

**Procedure**


Start the module: Declare module with 8-bit input and 3-bit output.

Use assign: Dataflow modeling uses assign statements (not always).

Encode inputs: Use conditional (? :) or logical expressions to assign 3-bit output based on the highest active input.

Priority: Ensure input[7] has the highest priority, down to input[0].

Binary code: Assign output bits as binary code corresponding to active input.

No simultaneous inputs: Assume only one input is high at a time.

End module: Close the module definition.

Testbench: (Optional) Create a testbench to verify the encoder's output for each input.
**PROGRAM**
```
module enc(a,b,c,y0,y1,y2,y3,y4,y5,y6,y7);
input y0,y1,y2,y3,y4,y5,y6,y7;
output a,b,c;
assign a= (y4 | y5 | y6 | y7);
assign b= (y2 | y3 | y6 | y7);
assign c= (y1 | y3 | y5 | y7);
endmodule

```
